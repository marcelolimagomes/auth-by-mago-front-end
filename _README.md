This is the front-end Angular application for the Auth by Mago project. It integrates with the back-end Spring Security application (auth-by-mago-back-end) to provide a user-friendly interface for authentication, user management, and profile management.

## Features

- **Login**: Authenticate users using JWT (JSON Web Token).
- **User Management**: Perform CRUD operations for users.
- **Profile Management**: Perform CRUD operations for user profiles.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Angular CLI (v15 or higher)
- Git

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the auth-by-mago-front-end repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/auth-by-mago-front-end.git
cd auth-by-mago-front-end
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure the Back-End URL

Ensure the back-end Spring Security application (auth-by-mago-back-end) is running. Update the API URLs in the Angular services if necessary:

- `src/app/services/auth.service.ts`
- `src/app/services/user.service.ts`
- `src/app/services/profile.service.ts`

For example:

```typescript
private apiUrl = 'http://localhost:8080/authenticate'; // Update if your back-end runs on a different port or host
```

### 4. Run the Application

Start the Angular development server:

```bash
ng serve
```

The application will be available at:

```plaintext
http://localhost:4200
```

### 5. Access the Application

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200`.

- Use the login page to authenticate.
- Navigate to the User Management and Profile Management sections to perform CRUD operations.
